# Running Hackflight on the Ladybug Flight Controller

The code in the the directories below allows you to run Hackflight on Kris Winer's brushed-motor 
[flight controller](https://www.oshpark.com/shared_projects/2rxr8Eff)
based on his STM32L432 "Ladybug" design. The first production run of LadybugFCs
is currently undergoing beta testing, after which we plan to sell it on <a
href="https://www.tindie.com/">Tindie</a>.  Our 
[wiki](https://github.com/simondlevy/Hackflight/wiki/Hackflight-LadybugFC-Wiki) 
will take you through the steps of setting up the board and using it on a quadcopter.

The <b>motortest</b> directory contains a little Arduino sketch you can run to test the motors.
