# Hackflight GCS: Simple Ground-Control Station for Hackflight firmware

This directory contains Python code for running a simple ground-control station to test the 
Hackflight firmware.  The GCS lets you visualize the attitude (roll, pitch, yaw) of your 
vehicle, as well as testing the motors (after removing the propellers, of course!), and testing the
signal from your R/C transmitter.
