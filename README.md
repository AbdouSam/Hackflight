# Hackflight: Simple quadcopter flight control firmware for C++ hackers

Hackflight is simple C++ firmware for inexpensive flight controllers.  It is geared toward people like me who want to 
tinker with flight-control firmware, and use it to teach students about ideas like inertial measurement 
and PID tuning.  If you are in the 99% percent of users who just want to fly your quadcopter without getting
into firmware hacking, I recommend Cleanflight.
