# Hackflight: Simple quadcopter flight control firmware for C++ hackers

Hackflight is simple C++ firmware for inexpensive quadcopter flight controllers.  It is geared toward people like me 
who want to tinker with flight-control firmware, and use it to teach students about ideas like inertial measurement 
and PID tuning.  If you are in the 99% percent of users who just want to get your vehicle flying without getting
into firmware hacking, I recommend [Cleanflight](http://cleanflight.com/) (great for getting started when you're on a 
budget) or the [Ardupilot](http://copter.ardupilot.org/ardupilot/index.html) system (for sophisticated mission 
planning with waypoint navigation and the like).

projects from which it is derived.
