# Hackflight GCS: Simpel Ground-Control Station for Hackflight firmware

This directory contains Python and Java code for running a simple ground-control station to test the 
Hackflight firmware.  The Python version lets you visualize the attitude (roll, pitch, yaw) of your 
vehicle, as well as testing the motors (after removing the propellers, of course!), and testing the
signal from your R/C transmitter.  The Java version currently just presents the attitude as a triplet
of numbers.
