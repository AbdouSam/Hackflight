<b>Quickstart, Windows</b>

<ol>
<li> Install <a href="http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html">V-REP</a>
<p><li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/simondlevy/hackflight/blob/master/sim/build/libv_repExtHackflight.dll">
DLL plugin file</a> to the V-REP folder. On my computer this is
<b>C:\Program FIles (x86)\V-REP3\V-REP_PRO_EDU</b>.
<p><li>Plug in your R/C transmitter, joystick, or game controller. Currently supported:
<p><ul>
<li> FrkSky Taranis transmitter with USB cable
<p><li>Spektrum DX-8 transmitter with GWS adapter cable (unfortunately no longer sold)
<p><li>Logitch Extreme 3D Pro joystick
<p><li>Nyko Core Controller for PS3
</ul>

<p><li> Navigate to the <b>hackflight/sim</b> folder and double-click <b>hackflight.ttt</b>
to launch V-REP
<p><li> Press the triangular play button at the top of V-REP.
<p><ul>
<p><li> If V-REP asks you whether you really want to run the simulation with a dt=10msec
update rate, agree.  You may have to do this three times.
<p><li>If the vehicle takes off immediately, make sure your throttle is down by
raising it slightly and then lowering it all the way down.
</ul>
<p><li>Press the square stop button at the top of V-REP to stop the simulation.

</ol>
